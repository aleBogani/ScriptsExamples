THE GAME
The aim of the game is to hit a target moving at the top of the screen with a bullet that is fired from the bottom, while avoiding some obstacles.
You have a total of 12 shots. Difficulty depends on four factors: 
* the wind's strength (Wind level);
* the target's speed (Speed level); 
* the target's size (Target level);
* the obstacles' width (Obstacle level). 
The complexity of each of these factors varies randomly on three different levels (the current level will be indicated in red). You have 30 seconds to make your shot. 
For each shot, your score will depend on whether you hit and where you hit the target. It can range from 0 (if the target is missed or the time runs out) to 10 (if you hit the bull's eye).

AIMING AND SHOOTING
Two actions are necessary to shoot the bullet.
* First, you must aim with the mouse pointer: Once fired, the bullet will head towards the position of the pointer, adjusted for the wind.   You are free to move the pointer all over the game screen; moving the pointer after the bullet has been fired will not change its trajectory.
* Shoot by pressing the "Shift" button (either the right or the left one).

WIND
Wind affects the trajectory of your shots. All the relevant information about it is presented in the lower part of the game screen. In particular:
* Wind force is indicated by the number in red. In each shot, the wind force can take one of three possible values, with higher numbers corresponding to higher intensities. 
* Wind direction is indicated by the arrow drawn next to the wind force values. The arrow can point either left or right, showing the direction the wind is blowing.
